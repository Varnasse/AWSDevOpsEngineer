# Domain 5: Incident and Event Response

### Certification Objectives

* Troubleshoot issues and determine how to restore operations
* Determine how to automate event management and alerting
* Apply concepts required to implement automated healing
* Apply concepts required to set up event-driven automated actions

### Troubleshooting Tips

#### Build a logging strategy

One of the best things you can do is establish a logging strategy. It is important to consider where the logs are being stored for both general storage and for access patterns.&#x20;

Use the CloudWatch logs agent for EC2/ECs to push logs to CloudWatch Logs

Centralize logging in a separate account, and use Kinesis firehose to move multiple streams of logging to S3 for example.

Log as much as you can even if you donâ€™t immediately use it

Keep logs as long as you can and use them for long-term analysis

#### Collect and aggregate data

In this example, we are showing how CloudWatch works well with AWS X-Ray:

#### Discern patterns by analysing data

* Analyse data to discern utilisation patterns
* Check the minimum and maximum, not just averages
  * Shows extremes and whether they are growing
* Analyse Elastic Load Balancing access logs and insert custom aggregate metrics into Amazon CloudWatch through Amazon EMR

#### Root access key use case

In this example, we are showing a method for how you could be notified should access keys from the root user be used to make API calls:

In this workflow, we would be using CloudTrail to work with CloudWatch in order to consume the logs and then make a custom metric in order to set up a CloudWatch alarm. Further down the line, we can have an Amazon SNS topic set up so that if an alarm is triggered, it sends a message of the topic and we can be notified.

### Automated healing

We are looking at how we can implement automation to help us recover from failure events.&#x20;

#### Use automation to quickly recover

AWS CloudFormation

* You can easily set up an automated action triggered by an alarm to relaunch your infrastructure based on a template.
* The mechanism to launch this would be built in and automated by you, but it provides a method for you to quickly recover full and highly customised architectures
* Will be using cfn-init or cloud-init with CloudFormation&#x20;

AWS Elastic Beanstalk

* A very similar mechanism to CloudFormation but its level of complexity is greatly reduced.
* You still have the ability to recover an application stack but keep in mind the differences between what you could do with the Elastic Beanstalk&#x20;

AWS OpsWorks

* This allows you to do some level of infrastructure management but it uses Chef or Puppet in order to provide you with mechanisms for building and configuring your resources.
* Creating recipes, cookbooks and modules that enable you to quickly recover your application

### Auto-scaling and lifecycle hooks&#x20;

#### Automation with Auto Scaling

Auto-scaling already automates the adding and removing of instances to your Auto-Scaling group based on the scaling policies that you set up.

#### Auto-scaling instance lifecycle

It is important to know the different actions that can be taken during the Auto Scaling process, how they operate, and what can be invoked and suspended.

#### Suspending Auto-scaling services

Knowing how to suspend the launch or terminate actions with Auto-scaling and understanding the reasons for doing so:

* Scaling processes
* Detach an instance
  * Move an instance from one Auto Scaling group to another
  * Testing purposes for running your application
* Standby state
  * Remove the instance from service, troubleshoot or make changes to it, and put it back into service
  * Doesn't actively handle application traffic until you put them back into service
* Launch
  * Disrupts other processes
* Terminate
  * Disrupts other processes
* AlarmNotifications
  * Accepts notifications from Amazon CloudWatch alarms that are associated with the group
* ReplaceUnhealthy
  * Terminates instances that are marked as unhealthy and later creates new instances to replace them
* HealthCheck
  * Checks the health of the instance
* AZRebalannce
  * Balances the number of EC2 instances in the group across the Availability Zones in the region
* AddToLoadBalancer
  * Adds instances to the attached load balancer or target group when they are launched

#### Auto-Scaling termination policies

* Default
  * Ensures instances span Availability Zones evenly for high availability
* Oldest instance
  * Upgrading instances in the Auto Scaling group to a new EC2 instance type&#x20;
* Newest instance
  * Testing a new launch configuration but do not want to keep it in production
  * Can be customised
* AllocationStrategy
  * Gradually replace On-Demand instances of a lower priority type with On-Demand instances of a higher priority type
* OldestlaunchConfig
  * Updating a group and phasing out the instances from a previous configuration
* OldestLaunchTemplate
  * Updating a group and phasing out the instances from a previous configuration
* ClosestToNextInstanceHour
  * Maximise the use of your instances and manage your Amazon EC2 usage costs
  * Can be customised

#### EC2 Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks

These hooks enable you to put certain actions on hold and trigger other actions to occur at specified stages.&#x20;

Instances can be put in a wait state in a lifecycle hook operation. The maximum amount of time to put an instance in a wait state is 48 hours (default is 1 hour).

When a scale-out event occurs, meaning that an instance or instances are being launched or when a scale-in event, meaning instances are being terminated.&#x20;

The lifecycle hooks allow these actions to be put into a pending state.&#x20;

#### Auto Scaling considerations

* You might need to combine multiple types of auto-scaling
* Your architecture might require more hands scaling using Step Scaling
* Some architectures need to scale on two or more metrics&#x20;
* Try to scale out early and fast
* Use lifecycle hooks

### Test Axioms

* Understand auto-scaling and lifecycle hooks
* Understand logging architectures
* Know how to use various methods for automation to recover
* Have experience with suspending load balancing and auto-scaling processes
